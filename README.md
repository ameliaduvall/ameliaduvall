Seabirds spend their lives under the water, in the sky, and on land, where they are exposed to a range of threats like invasive predators, fisheries bycatch, and impacts from climate change. As a result, they are one of the most endangered groups of birds in the world. Since a lot of seabirds spend most of their lives at sea and only come to remote islands to breed, they can be notoriously difficult to study. I use a suite of field methods including acoustic recording devices, bird banding, satellite tracking, camera traps, nest monitoring, and more to peak into their lives. Then, I use quantitative methods in population ecology to understand the status and drivers of seabird populations as well as decision-analytic methods to inform management actions to conserve populations.
